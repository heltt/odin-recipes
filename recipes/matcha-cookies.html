    <p>Learn how to make some delicious matcha cookies!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, softened (regular or vegan)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups + 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon matcha powder, sifted</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 cup semisweet or white chocolate chips or chopped chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine flour, sifted match powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment or a handheld mixer, combine butter and sugars, beating until light and fluffy (around 1-2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add in egg and vanilla, then beat until just combined (do not over-mix!).</li>
        <li>Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Use a medium cookie scoop or spoon to make 1.5-2 tablespoon sized balls and place them on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies (one baking sheet at a time, for even baking) for 8-11 minutes. Remove them from the oven when the edges look set. They will look slightly under-baked in the middle and should not be golden brown!</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and leave them on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
